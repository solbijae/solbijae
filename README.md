## Hi there 👋

I am a Product Manager and Full-Stack Developer with experience leading the entire product lifecycle—from planning and design to development and maintenance. I enjoy identifying problems, designing solutions, and driving their execution while balancing user needs and technical feasibility. As a proactive self-learner, I continuously refine my skills and embrace challenges as opportunities to improve.
